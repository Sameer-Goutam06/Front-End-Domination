Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the `@keyframes` CSS at-rule and CSS animations with examples.

### `@keyframes` Rule:

The `@keyframes` rule allows you to define a set of style changes that occur over the course of an animation. Let's take an example of a simple slide-in animation for a div element.

```css
@keyframes slidein {
  from {
    transform: translateX(-100%);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateX(0%);
  }
}

/* Applying the animation to an element */
.element {
  animation-name: slidein;
  animation-duration: 2s; /* Animation duration */
}
```

In this example:
- We define a keyframe animation called `slidein`.
- The animation starts with the element translated 100% to the left (`transform: translateX(-100%)`) and ends with no translation (`transform: translateX(0%)`).
- Then, we apply this animation to an HTML element with the class `.element`.
- The animation duration is set to 2 seconds.

### Keyframes and Properties:

Keyframes allow us to specify intermediate styles at different points of an animation. Each keyframe represents a specific point in the animation's timeline. Properties not defined in every keyframe are interpolated.

```css
@keyframes example {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(-100%);
  }
  50% {
    opacity: 0.5;
    transform: translateY(50%);
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0%);
  }
}
```

In this example:
- At `0%`, the element is invisible (`opacity: 0`) and translated 100% up (`transform: translateY(-100%)`).
- At `50%`, the opacity increases to 0.5 and the element is translated halfway down.
- At `100%`, the opacity is fully visible (`opacity: 1`) and the element is translated to its original position.

### `!important` in Keyframes:

Declarations within keyframes qualified with `!important` are ignored.

```css
@keyframes important {
  from {
    margin-top: 50px;
  }
  50% {
    margin-top: 150px !important; /* Ignored */
  }
  to {
    margin-top: 100px;
  }
}
```

In this example, the `margin-top` property with `!important` is ignored at the `50%` keyframe.

### CSS Animations:

CSS animations allow for smoother transitions between styles compared to simple changes. Here's an example of a CSS animation:

```css
/* Defining the animation */
@keyframes fadein {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

/* Applying the animation to an element */
.element {
  animation-name: fadein;
  animation-duration: 2s;
}
```

In this example:
- We define a keyframe animation called `fadein` that gradually changes the opacity of an element from 0 to 1.
- Then, we apply this animation to an HTML element with the class `.element`.
- The animation duration is set to 2 seconds.

CSS animations provide more control over the intermediate steps of an animation sequence compared to transitions, making them suitable for more complex animations.
